					Serbian-American engineer and physicist Nikola Tesla (1856-1943) made dozens of breakthroughs in the production, transmission and
					application of electric power. He invented the first alternating current (AC) motor and developed AC generation and transmission
					technology. Though he was famous and respected, he was never able to translate his copious inventions into long-term financial
					success—unlike his early employer and chief rival, Thomas Edison.
				</p>
				<h3>Nikola Tesla’s Early Years</h3>
				<p>
					Nikola Tesla was born in 1856 in Smiljan, Croatia, then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. His father was a priest in the
					Serbian Orthodox church and his mother managed the family’s farm. In 1863 Tesla’s brother Daniel was killed in a riding accident.
					The shock of the loss unsettled the 7-year-old Tesla, who reported seeing visions—the first signs of his lifelong mental
					illnesses. Tesla studied math and physics at the Technical University of Graz and philosophy at the University of Prague. In 1882,
					while on a walk, he came up with the idea for a brushless AC motor, making the first sketches of its rotating electromagnets in
					the sand of the path. Later that year he moved to Paris and got a job repairing direct current (DC) power plants with the
					Continental Edison Company. Two years later he immigrated to the United States.

				<h3>Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison</h3>
				<p>
					Tesla arrived in New York in 1884 and was hired as an engineer at Thomas Edison’s Manhattan headquarters. He worked there for a
					year, impressing Edison with his diligence and ingenuity. At one point Edison told Tesla he would pay $50,000 for an improved
					design for his DC dynamos. After months of experimentation, Tesla presented a solution and asked for the money. Edison demurred,
					saying, “Tesla, you don’t understand our American humor.” Tesla quit soon after.

				<h3>Nikola Tesla’s Failures, Death and Legacy</h3>
				<p>
					n 1895 Tesla’s New York lab burned, destroying years’ worth of notes and equipment. Tesla relocated to Colorado Springs for two
					years, returning to New York in 1900. He secured backing from financier J.P. Morgan and began building a global communications
					network centered on a giant tower at Wardenclyffe, on Long Island. But funds ran out and Morgan balked at Tesla’s grandiose
					schemes. Tesla lived his last decades in a New York hotel, working on new inventions even as his energy and mental health faded.
					His obsession with the number three and fastidious washing were dismissed as the eccentricities of genius. He spent his final
					years feeding—and, he claimed, communicating with—the city’s pigeons. Tesla died in his room on January 7, 1943. Later that year
					the U.S. Supreme Court voided four of Marconi’s key patents, belatedly acknowledging Tesla’s innovations in radio. The AC system
					he championed and improved remains the global standard for power transmission.
